# PlayGroundDevOpsTool
      This repository contains code base of our partial deployment engine which work like other Devops tools(Jenkins, Autorabit, Circle CI)<br>
      Heart of this repository is residing in build.xml file.
# Features Covered
       1. Required no knowledge of DevOps to run this as long as developers/testers/admins know how to use DOS/Command Prompt/Terminal.
       2. With click of a single command your package will be pulled from your sandbox and will push all the changes to GIT remote repository.
       3. Changes from GIT will be pulled with one click of command and will be deployed to the desired sandbox and the deployment will happen for the delta changes, not all the changes will go.
       4. User friendly as we have controls with us weather to push the changes or not or deploy the changes or not.
       5. Easy to maintain - no additional knowledge of DevOps is required as we have wrote the code in simple XML and JS.
       6. Cheaper then any other tools.
       7. No need to wait for tech support as the source code will reside within the comapny and there are chances of improvement to the existing tool as well.
